African Marketplace App

African Marketplace empowers small business owners, particularly women, to improve their business and economic opportunities to grow out of poverty. A small business owner can login and see relevant prices in various categories to help them set their own prices. They can also make listing for items they want to sell, which will show up to all users. Business owners can add a new item by selecting their market location and typing in their item's name, description, and price. With an easy UI, small business owners can trade across borders legally, profitably, and safely.

This is an app designed during a Lambda School build week.
